# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation


Write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [UFO sightings dataset](/static/js/data.js). Users will be able to filter the table data for specific values. Use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.


## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to the index.html file and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional-Unfinished)

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
